#summary Add a js slide show engine.
#labels Phase-Design

= Introduction =

Having a one click nice slideshow would be a good enhancement to the user experience. This has probably to be done on the client side and javascript would be a good fit.

== Changes ==

=== Python ===

We would have to embed some js (callbacks) inside the HTML pages

=== Java Script ===

The whole thing would be done in a separate bunch of JS scripts, located somewhere inside the generated directory. The flickr slideshow is really cool, such a slidewhow code can be fetched from [http://www.robertnyman.com/jas/ here].
