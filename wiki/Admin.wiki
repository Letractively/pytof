If you want to edit the wiki offline, it's possible as the wiki is under subversion also. Didn't do it yet but should be simple to figure out the svn path from [http://pytof.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/ that].
I just did that, you simply have to replace trunk with wiki ... the big bonnus
is that you can use your prefered editor to do that, and edit several files at
a time, fast, without the need to save (and wait) if you want to switch to
another wiki page.

== Wiki ==

Quote from the FAQ:
{{{
What syntax are you using in the wiki?
    Our wiki syntax is inspired by the MoinMoin wiki syntax, and is more or less a subset of it. We've found that MoinMoin is one of the most popular open source wikis and provides a clean syntax for users. 
    Specific examples of how to use the wiki syntax are shown in the "Wiki Markup Help" box on the right-hand side of the wiki page creation and editing pages.

== Editors ==

Mathieu uses Eclipse with the pydev module, and Benjamin wants to learn vim ...
but needs multiple viewports as explained
[http://applications.linux.com/article.pl?sid=06/05/04/1544258&tid=13 here].
