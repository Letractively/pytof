== Introduction ==

For thumbnails creation pytof rely on the python imaging library (PIL), which itself rely on the libjpeg for low level jpeg handling. Both of them should be installed, and the process is quite simple.

== Install dependancies using prepackaged binaries ==

=== Mac ===

==== Panther ====

I made a PIL archive where PIL is compiled against a static libjpeg, so it should be self contained.
{{{
[100drine@gnocchi tmp]$ cd /Library/Python/2.3/    
[100drine@gnocchi 2.3]$ sudo curl -O http://pytof.googlecode.com/files/PIL-PPC-Panther-python-2.3.tar.bz2
[100drine@gnocchi 2.3]$ sudo bunzip2 -c PIL-PPC-Panther-python-2.3.tar.bz2 | tar xf -
}}}
When sudo ask you a password, type your user password.
Otherwise I'm sure fink has a prepackaged PIL.

=== Linux ===

Under mandriva the package name is python-imaging.

=== Solaris ===

Installing [http://www.blastwave.org/packages/pil PIL] using [http://www.blastwave.org blastwave] will  do all the job for you.

=== Windows ===

 * Install [http://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.4.4/python-2.4.4.msi python] 
 * Install [http://effbot.org/downloads/PIL-1.1.6.win32-py2.4.exe PIL]
 * For now there is no GUI so you'll have to type commands in a terminal. To
get a nice experience you should install [http://www.cygwin.com/mirrors.html
cygwin] which comes with [http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/ bash].
 
== Install dependancies from sources ==

The drawback is that you need to install the developper tools on the Mac, (a good 1Gigabyte dmg to download, hum ...) to get gcc that is required to build PIL and libjpeg. As there is a windows installer on the PIL site, you'd better use that one. And on Linux most likely you will have pre-packaged PIL and libjpeg, otherwise install gcc.

=== Automatic ===

The sources for the open source project were added to our sources in the deps
directory.  A simple *install.sh* script can be found in the deps directory.
To have a verbose output, run it like `sh -x install.sh`.
If you get pytof throught subversion you'll get those sources for free,
otherwise download them from the download page.

You'll just have to enter your account password as it calls sudo sometimes.

=== Manual ===

Maybe install.sh won't work for you, so here are the steps to follow.

==== libjpeg ====

We should provide a tar file compiled on a MacTel with Tiger soon with the right file.
Grab that [ftp://ftp.uu.net/graphics/jpeg/jpegsrc.v6b.tar.gz here]. I had a bad experience with the default configure, so I had to manually copy the header and the static library to /usr/local. You may have to download the developper tools from the main Apple website, but I think there's a default gcc there and it's all you need.

{{{
$ tar zxf jpegsrc.v6b.tar.gz
$ cd jpeg-6b
$ ./configure
$ sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/{include,lib}
$ sudo cp *.h /usr/local/include
$ sudo cp libjpeg.a /usr/local/lib
}}}

==== PIL ====

Grab the source code [http://effbot.org/downloads/Imaging-1.1.6.tar.gz here], extract it and from the PIL main dir, issue that:

{{{
sudo python setup.py install
}}}

You should be good to go, and ready to play with pytof !!

== gtof ==

gtof is the name of the pytof graphical user interface. It is using the pygtk toolkit + libglade, so you'll have to install both of them.

=== Linux ===

Just use your installer manager to get glade-3 and pygtk (urpmi, yum, apt-get).

=== Windows ===

An all in one installer is being prepared by the pygtk fols, but for now:

 * Install gtk+ and glade from [http://gladewin32.sourceforge.net/modules/news/ here]. I used the 2.10.7 version.
 * Look for the Win32 Installer section in the pygtk [http://www.pygtk.org/downloads.html download] page, and install those tree guys: PyCairo (1.2), PyGObject (2.12), PyGTK (2.10)

=== Mac ===

Fink / x11 is needed for now, but there may be a lighter process as there is now a non X11 gtk implementation on the Mac, which is good news.

== One click Installer ==

Of course in the near future we'd like to make a nice OS X package, so that no-one would have to experience tar and configure nice moments ...
